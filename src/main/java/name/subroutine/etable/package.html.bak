This package is used to access data of the "table" type.  A table
is organized into records.  Each record includes one or more fields:
</p>

<pre>

          Field 1    Field 2    Field 3      Field 4 ....
Record 1  111        222        333          444
Record 2  111        222        333          444
Record 3  111        222        333          444
...

</pre>

<p>
The fields do not have to be of the same type.  The records must
consist of the same fields, in the same order.
</p>

<p>
There are currently many types of formats that follow the "table"
standard: SDF (fixed length), DBF (database format used by dBASE
family of software), and CSV (comma delimited).
</p>

<p>
The classes in the package include fields, records, and tables.  All
fields inherit the interface Field:

<pre>
    Field                               interface
        AbstractField                   base class that implements Field
        ByteField                       field with byte boundaries
            EtableField                 Etable field
            DBFField                    ...
